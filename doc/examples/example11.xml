gap> ### THIS IS A GAP PACKAGE FOR COMPUTING NON-COMMUTATIVE GROBNER BASES 
gap>  
<#GAPDoc Label="Example11">
<Section Label="Example11"><Heading>The truncated variant on two weighted homogeneous polynomials</Heading>
Here we exhibit a truncated non-commutative homogeneous weighted Gröbner
basis computation. This example uses the functions from Section <Ref
Sect="truncfun"/>, the truncation variants (see also Section <Ref
Sect="trunc"/>).
<P/>
The input is a set of polynomials in <M>x</M> and <M>y</M>, which
are homogeneous when the weight of <M>x</M> is 2 and of <M>y</M> is 3.
The input is <M>\{x^3y^2-x^6+y^4,y^2x^3+xyxyx+x^2yxy\}</M>.
We truncate the computation at degree 16.
The truncated Gröbner basis is 
<M>\{y^2x^3+xyxyx+x^2yxy,x^6-x^3y^2-y^4,x^3y^2x-x^4y^2-xy^4\}</M>
and the dimension of the quotient algebra is 134.
<P/>
First load the package and set the standard infolevel <Ref
InfoClass="InfoGBNP" Style="Text"/> to 1 and the time infolevel <Ref
Func="InfoGBNPTime" Style="Text"/> to 1 (for more information about the info
level, see Chapter <Ref Chap="Info"/>).


<Listing><![CDATA[
gap> LoadPackage("gbnp", false);
true
gap> SetInfoLevel(InfoGBNP,1);
gap> SetInfoLevel(InfoGBNPTime,1);
]]></Listing>

The variables will be printed as <M>x</M> and <M>y</M>.
<Listing><![CDATA[
gap> GBNP.ConfigPrint("x","y");
]]></Listing>

The level to truncate at is assigned to <M>n</M>.

<Listing><![CDATA[
gap> n := 16;;
]]></Listing>

Now enter the relations in NP form (see Section <Ref Sect="NP"/>) and the
weights.

<Listing><![CDATA[
gap> s1 :=[[[1,1,1,2,2],[1,1,1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]],[1,-1,1]];;
gap> s2 :=[[[2,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,2,1,2]],[1,1,1]];;
gap> K := [s1,s2];;
gap> weights:=[2,3];;
]]></Listing>

The input can be printed with <Ref Func="PrintNPList" Style="Text"/>

<Listing><![CDATA[
gap> PrintNPList(K);
 x^3y^2 - x^6 + y^4 
 y^2x^3 + xyxyx + x^2yxy 
]]></Listing>

Verify whether the list <C>K</C> consists only of polynomials that are
homogeneous with respect to <C>weights</C>
by means of  <Ref Func="CheckHomogeneousNPs" Style="Text"/>.

<Listing><![CDATA[
gap> CheckHomogeneousNPs(K,weights);
#I  Input is homogeneous
[ 12, 12 ]
]]></Listing>


Now calculate the truncated Gröbner basis with <Ref Func="SGrobnerTrunc"
Style="Text"/>. The output will only contain homogeneous polynomials
of degree at most <C>n</C>.

<Listing><![CDATA[
gap> G := SGrobnerTrunc(K,n,weights);;
#I  number of entered polynomials is 2
#I  number of polynomials after reduction is 2
#I  End of phase I
#I  Input is homogeneous
#I  Reached level 16
#I  end of the algorithm
#I  The computation took 4 msecs.
]]></Listing>

The Gröbner basis of the truncated quotient algebra can be printed with <Ref
Func="PrintNPList" Style="Text"/>:

<Listing><![CDATA[
gap> PrintNPList(G);
 y^2x^3 + xyxyx + x^2yxy 
 x^6 - x^3y^2 - y^4 
 x^3y^2x - x^4y^2 + y^4x - xy^4 
]]></Listing>

The standard basis of the quotient of the free noncommutative algebra
on <M>n</M> variables, where 
<M>n</M> is the length of the vector <C>weights</C>,
by the homogeneous ideal generated by <C>K</C> 
up to degree <M>n</M>
is obtained by means of the function
<Ref Func="BaseQATrunc" Style="Text"/>
applied to <C>K</C>, <C>n</C>, and <C>weights</C>.

<Listing><![CDATA[
gap> B := BaseQATrunc(K,n,weights);;
#I  number of entered polynomials is 2
#I  number of polynomials after reduction is 2

#I  end of the algorithm
#I  The computation took 0 msecs.
gap> i := Length(B);

gap> Print("at level ",i-1," the standard monomials are:\n");
at level 16 the standard monomials are:

 yx^2yx^3

The same result can be obtained by using the truncated Gröbner basis
found for <C>G</C> instead of <C>K</C>.

<Listing><![CDATA[
gap> B2 := BaseQATrunc(G,n,weights);;
#I  number of entered polynomials is 3
#I  number of polynomials after reduction is 3
#I  End of phase I
#I  Input is homogeneous
#I  Reached level 16
#I  end of the algorithm
#I  The computation took 0 msecs.
gap> B = B2;
true
]]></Listing>

Also, the same result can be obtained by using the
leading terms of the truncated Gröbner basis
found for <C>G</C> instead of <C>K</C>.

<Listing><![CDATA[
gap> B3 := BaseQATrunc(List( LMonsNP(G), qq -> [[qq],[1]]),n,weights);;
#I  number of entered polynomials is 3
#I  number of polynomials after reduction is 3
#I  End of phase I
#I  Input is homogeneous
#I  Reached level 16
#I  end of the algorithm
#I  The computation took 0 msecs.
gap> B = B3;
true
]]></Listing>

up to degree <M>n</M> is obtained by means of
<Ref Func="DimsQATrunc" Style="Text"/>

Even more detailed information is given by the list of

This is obtained by means of
