The options record contains the following names:

Alphabetsize : the number of generators
CancellativeMonoid : if bound then g_i(w1+w2+...+w_i)=0 -> w1+w2+...+w_i=0
    (same for (w1+w2+...+w_i)g_i ) (if i>1)
    requires alphabetsize
    NOTE: g_i+n will be used for the cancellation of g_i
    (make sure to set up algebras and GBNP.ConfigPrint accordingly)
pg ? : number of prefix generators (not used yet)
PrintLetterFunction : set automatically by GBNP.ConfigPrint
cleancount ? : cleaning the GB with itself each cleancount times
cleanpolys ? : clean the GB with itself after the first next loop.
PrintTraceAsGP : if Algebra is also set, print the trace as GP
Algebra : the FreeAssociativeAlgebraWithOne corresponding to the relations
