Summary:
A) Resuming Grobnerloop
  - better documentation is needed, preferably in the form of a well documented
    example (new or modified ?) example07m.g is a bit of a start, but a new
    example might be better.
  - documentation of new functions should be checked as well
B) Examples (in particular for all functions)
  - There is a list as below. Some examples could be extended. A plan of
    approach should be made.
  - inventarisation
    - example with NP <-> GP conversion: not fully done
    - example with printing: not fully done
    - example with NP arithmetic: not fully done
    - example with Grobner (instead of SGrobner): not present
    - example needed for interrupted
      SGrobner/IsGrobnerPair/MakeGrobnerPair/IsGrobnerBasis
      (see above)
    - section needed where these functions are described:
      SGrobner/IsGrobnerPair/MakeGrobnerPair/IsGrobnerBasis
    - example with quotient algebras and representations/calculations
      why use compressed matrices ?
      StrongNormalForm (and how to make it quicker)
    - example with finiteness: split between 13-16: create one combined example
    - example for trace exists: colagen, add EvalTrace, PrintTraceList
    - example for trunc exists: two weighted homogeneous polynomials
    - example for modules: 4,18-22 combine all functions in one (?)
C) Other
  - Is 0 homogeneous ? The implementations says no, is that correct ?
D) Some things for the next version
  - make a list here

some draft items below

=======================================
First version of time schedule

now: 22 april
summary of todo items:
- make inventarisation of tasks *mostly done*
- make elaborate time schedule allowing to finish in May *mostly done*
- look at examples (usage of functions) (4) *mostly done*
! finish grobnerloop resuming (1,3,5) *check*
29th of april
- add new examples where needed/reference to examples (4)
- JW: test truncated code
  -> examples seem good (although A.3 does not use truncation and does not say
     anything about being homogeneous, so it might be confusing, *discuss with
     Arjeh*)
  -> code review:
     . check NondivMonsByLevel zero case (*done*)
     ! for CheckHomogeneousNPs : is zero homogeneous ? (answer seems to be no,
       *ask Arjeh*) (*urgent*)
     + false should become fail (-> next version)
     + it would make sense for GBNP.CheckHom to use WieghtedDegreeMon (> next version)
     + ObsTrunc might be made quicker by using the normal function to get
       Obstructions using lists
- check new theory (2)
8 may
- new versions (what does this mean)
- add other todo items that need to be done here
15 may
- final reading and testing
20 may
- spare week, for things that take longer and things that come up after
  inventarisation and can not be done earlier

URGENT:

SHORT TERM:
- MakeGrobnerPair function (create a [weak] partial pair)
  DONE:
  - first version
  - automatically stop (S)Grobner calculations after a certain number of
    iterations
  TODO:
  - (1) check difference between IsGrobnerPair and IsGrobner
    -> 1) elements of a Grobner basis don't have to be monic (can contain <0>)
          or leading coefficients different from <1>
    -> 2) how about being able to reduce with itself /multiple entries ?
          -> seems to be allowed in both cases.
    - decide what to do : combine ?
  - (2) amc: check updated documentation for (S)Grobner (jwk: ok)
  - (3)create example that (first version 7m)
    - (S)Grobner stopping after a certain number of iterations
    - IsGrobnerPair (leaving out something from or adding something to todo)
    - MakeGrobnerPair
    - possibly IsGrobner
- Examples for more functions
  TODO: (4)
  - inventarisation
    - example with NP <-> GP conversion: not fully done
    - example with printing: not fully done
    - example with NP arithmetic: not fully done
    - example with Grobner (instead of SGrobner): not present
    - example needed for interrupted
      SGrobner/IsGrobnerPair/MakeGrobnerPair/IsGrobnerBasis
      (see above)
    - section needed where these functions are described:
      SGrobner/IsGrobnerPair/MakeGrobnerPair/IsGrobnerBasis
    - example with quotient algebras and representations/calculations
      why use compressed matrices ?
      StrongNormalForm (and how to make it quicker)
    - example with finiteness: split between 13-16: create one combined example
    - example for trace exists: colagen, add EvalTrace, PrintTraceList
    - example for trunc exists: two weighted homogeneous polynomials
    - example for modules: 4,18-22 combine all functions in one (?)
  - create examples
DONE
  - name change (if amc agrees) (to be done by jwk)
  - make GBNP.IsGrobnerPair global
  - make GBNP.MakeGrobnerPair global
  - rename IsGrobnerBasisTest IsGrobnerBasis
  - rename IsStrongGrobnerBasisTest IsStrongGrobnerBasis
  - document new global functions where no documentation was available
  - also rename in documentation/examples/top of files
========================================
- options.gi: describe better how options work, which options there are and
  where they are used -> already in OPTIONS
- jwk: check status: tree/occurtree vs graphs
- jwk: describe cancellation
- jwk: printing.gi: fix code duplication in PrintNP and GBNP.PrintNPnonewline
- jwk: make kary-heap optional/remove it (too complicated)
- jwk: tree.gi: see if code using tree.gi can be rewritten to use occurtree
- jwk: describe various functions for (strong) normal form
- jwk: make inventarization which functions have multiple versions (and add documenting these to the todo list)
- make test cases for performance testing

NOT urgent:
- occurtree: idea: make interface easier with objects
- check whether all functions use funcs.strong
- combine ReducePolTails/ReducePolTailsPTS
- ReducePol2 can be faster: remove Occur (at XXX)

Urgent but not directly possible:
- fix reducepol functions (what/how?)
- functions for splitting np/npm polynomials (???)
- PTS + Cancellation (what is required here, now prefix generators cannot be
  cancelled, is this wat is intended)

- DimQA that gets pg from the GBR record
- DimQA that does not calculate the whole QA but only counts (depth first)
- reduce the number of prefix functions further (by using the two-sided
  functions instead)
- options in a record for every calculation, possibly initialized with standard
  options at the beginning of the calculation
- make cleancount/cleanpolys options
- possible to use lt, gt everywhere (add ?/conditions)
- Gröbner basis record / objects
- remove function StrongNormalForm2 (by adding occur trees to a Gröbner basis
  record)
- put the prefix generators in the end of the list for trees -> saves space

NOTES:
ReducePol2:
    - trace.gi:GBNP.ReducePolTrace2

ReducePol: (probably no changing)
    - trace.gi:GBNP.ReducePolTrace

ReducePol functions:

grobner.gi:GBNP.ReducePol
    calls ReducePol2

grobner_t.gi:GBNP.ReducePol2        G, GLOT
    trees, poss prefix-unaware: StrongNormalForm2TS
trace.gi:GBNP.ReducePolTrace2
trace.gi:GBNP.ReducePolTrace

grobnerloops2.gi:GBNP.ReducePolTailsPTS
    not a reduce function -> Cleans -> Name is confusing



functions that need to know pg:
-> now in occurtree, only CreateOccurTreeLR remains

for CreateOccurTreeLR: nog doen tree.g graphs.g fincheck.g
    AllObs, LeftObsT, RightObsT, ReducePol2, StrongNormalFormT (grobner_t.gi)
